/**
 * 
  Javascript is single threaded language
  due to which when various fucntion calls or events are put into queue that is called as EVENT QUEUE
  Event looop is the execution of various functions and events from stack of event queue (CALL STACK)
 */

// All `thenable`(Promise) callbacks of the promise are called first, then the setTimeout callback is called.

// Job Queue has high priority in executing callbacks, if event loop tick comes to Job Queue, it will execute all the 
//jobs in job queue
// first until it gets empty, then will move to callback queue.

/* Priority
 1. Main stack execution   // all kind of task execution
 2. Job Queue (also called microtask queue) // only reserved for Promises
    EXAMPLES: Mircotasks include: MutationObserver, Promise.then() and Promise.catch(), other techniques based on Promise such 
    as the fetch API, V8 garbage collection process, process.nextTick() in node environment.
 3. Callback queue (task queue)   //settimeout (all kinds of web APIs)
 */

/**if microtask queue keeps on mutating continuos thenable statements, it will not allow      
 * callback queue to execute this is called STARVATION
 */

console.log("Message no. 1: Sync"); // executes 1

setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("Message no. 2: setTimeout"); // executes 6
}, 0);

var promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  console.log("Message no. 3: inside promise, before resolve"); // executes 2
  resolve();
});

promise
  .then(function (resolve) {
    console.log("Message no. 4: 1st Promise"); // executes 4
  })
  .then(function (resolve) {
    console.log("Message no. 5: 2nd Promise"); // executes 5
  });

console.log("Message no. 6: Sync"); // executes 3
