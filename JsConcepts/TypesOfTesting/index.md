## 1. Unit Tests

**Purpose**: To test individual components or functions in isolation.
**Focus**: Smallest units of code, such as functions, methods, or classes.
**Example**: Testing a function that calculates the sum of two numbers.
**Tools**: Jest, Mocha, Jasmine for JavaScript; JUnit for Java; NUnit for .NET.

## 2. Integration Tests

**Purpose**: To test the interaction between integrated units or components.
**Focus**: Ensuring that multiple components work together as expected.
**Example**: Testing the interaction between a database and a repository layer.
**Tools**: Mocha, Jasmine for JavaScript; TestNG for Java; Xunit for .NET.

## 3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests

**Purpose**: To test the complete flow of an application from start to finish.
**Focus**: User scenarios and workflows to ensure the application behaves correctly.
**Example**: Testing a user login process, from entering credentials to seeing the dashboard.
**Tools**: Cypress, Selenium, Protractor.

## 4. Functional Tests

**Purpose**: To verify that specific functionality works as expected.
**Focus**: Functional requirements and use cases.
**Example**: Testing that a user can successfully create an account.
**Tools**: Similar to tools used for integration and E2E tests.

## 5. Regression Tests

**Purpose**: To ensure that new code changes do not adversely affect existing functionality.
**Focus**: Existing functionality after updates or enhancements.
**Example**: Running a suite of tests after a new feature is added to check for unexpected breaks.
**Tools**: Automated test suites using any of the above-mentioned testing frameworks.

## 6. Smoke Tests

**Purpose**: To perform a preliminary check to see if the build is stable enough for further testing.
**Focus**: Basic functionalities of the application.
**Example**: Verifying that the application launches and key features are accessible.
**Tools**: Often automated, using tools for unit or integration tests.

## 7. Sanity Tests

**Purpose**: To verify that a particular function or bug fix works as expected.
**Focus**: A subset of regression tests, usually more focused and narrow.
**Example**: Testing a bug fix to ensure the reported issue is resolved.
**Tools**: Manual or automated testing frameworks.

## 8. Performance Tests

**Purpose**: To determine the performance characteristics of an application.
**Focus**: Speed, responsiveness, and stability under load.
**Example**: Testing how many users an application can handle before performance degrades.
**Tools**: JMeter, Gatling, LoadRunner.

## 9. Load Tests

**Purpose**: To test the application’s ability to handle a specific load.
**Focus**: Number of users, transactions, or data volume.
**Example**: Simulating 1,000 concurrent users to see how the application performs.
**Tools**: JMeter, Gatling.

## 10. Stress Tests

**Purpose**: To determine the application’s behavior under extreme conditions.
**Focus**: Limits of the application by pushing beyond normal operational capacity.
**Example**: Increasing the load until the system crashes to identify the breaking point.
**Tools**: JMeter, Gatling.

## 11. Usability Tests

**Purpose**: To evaluate the user-friendliness and overall user experience.
**Focus**: User interactions, interface design, and ease of use.
**Example**: Observing users as they navigate the application to identify pain points.
**Tools**: User testing platforms like UserTesting, Lookback.

## 12. Security Tests

**Purpose**: To identify vulnerabilities and ensure data protection.
**Focus**: Application security, including authentication, authorization, data encryption.
**Example**: Testing for SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other vulnerabilities.
**Tools**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.

## 13. Compatibility Tests

**Purpose**: To ensure the application works across different environments.
**Focus**: Various browsers, devices, operating systems, and network configurations.
**Example**: Testing a web application on different browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari.
**Tools**: BrowserStack, Sauce Labs.

## 14. Acceptance Tests

**Purpose**: To verify that the application meets the business requirements.
**Focus**: End-to-end workflows and user acceptance criteria.
**Example**: Running scenarios defined by the product owner to ensure business needs are met.
**Tools**: Cucumber, FitNesse.

## 15. Exploratory Tests

**Purpose**: To discover defects by exploring the application without predefined tests.
**Focus**: Ad-hoc testing based on tester’s experience and intuition.
**Example**: Navigating through the application and trying different inputs to find issues.
**Tools**: Manual testing, with potential use of test session recording tools.

Each type of testing serves a specific purpose and helps ensure the overall quality and robustness of the product. Integrating these tests into your development process will lead to a more reliable and user-friendly application.
