# Core web vitals

## Page size: The total file size of all the code, assets, and everything else needed on the page.

## Load time: Closely related to page size, this is the amount of time required to load all the aforementioned assets.

## Time to first byte (TTFB): Time taken until the server responds with some data. This also enhances SEO rankings.

## DOMContentLoaded (DCL): Time taken for the full HTML code to load. This does not include CSS, JavaScript, or other assets.

## Time to interactive (TTI): Time taken until the user can interact with any interactive element, e.g., buttons, inputs, etc.

## First contentful paint (FCP): Time until assets start being displayed on the webpage, whether it be text, images, or even backgrounds.

## Time to above-the-fold load: Time until the topmost content on the page finishes loading, showing the user completed content without scrolling down.

## Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): The render time of the largest image or text block visible within the viewport, relative to when the page first started loading.

## First Input Delay (FID): Measures load responsiveness because it quantifies the experience users feel when trying to interact with unresponsive pages. A low FID helps ensure that the page is usable.

## Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Measures visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts. A low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful.
