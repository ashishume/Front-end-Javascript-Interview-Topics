# S.O.L.I.D principles

 - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
    - A component should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one responsibility or perform one task.

 - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
    - Components should be open for extension but closed for modification. You should be able to extend a component's behavior without modifying its source code.

 - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
    - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program. In React, this often translates to ensuring that components can be replaced with their derived components without breaking the app.

 - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
    - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This means creating more specific interfaces instead of one general-purpose interface.

 - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
    - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. In React, this often means using hooks or context to decouple components from specific implementations.
