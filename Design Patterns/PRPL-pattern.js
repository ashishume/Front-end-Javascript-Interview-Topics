  The PRPL pattern is a web performance optimization strategy advocated by Google, especially 
  for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). PRPL stands for:

- Push critical resources for the initial URL route.
- Render the initial route as soon as possible.
- Pre-cache remaining routes.
- Lazy-load and create remaining routes on demand.
