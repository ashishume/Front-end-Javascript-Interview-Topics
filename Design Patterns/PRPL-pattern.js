  The PRPL pattern is a web performance optimization strategy advocated by Google, especially 
  for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). PRPL stands for:

- PUSH:  Pushing critical resources efficiently, which minimizes the amount of roundtrips to the server and reducing the loading time.
- RENDER: Rendering the initial route soon as possible to improve the user experience
- PRE-CACHING: Pre-caching assets in the background for frequently visited routes to minimize the amount of requests to the server and enable a better offline experience
- LAZY LOADING: Lazily loading routes or assets that arenâ€™t requested as frequently
